we will be adding some custom error pages

so right now if we go http://127.0.0.1:5000/testpage we will get the page not exist error 404

then if we rtry to update posts that not belong to the user we will get permission error 403
http://127.0.0.1:5000/post/new/5/update

this shows how we can use blueprint, so we have just created our custom error pages with the help of blueprint
