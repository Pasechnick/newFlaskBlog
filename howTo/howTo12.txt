we will be adding some custom error pages. That shows us how with the help of blueprints we can add some additional features by adding sections

so right now if we go http://127.0.0.1:5000/testpage we will get the page not exist error 404

then if we retry to update posts that not belong to the user we will get permission error 403
http://127.0.0.1:5000/post/new/5/update

this shows how we can use blueprint, so we have just created our custom error pages with the help of blueprint

so the way to create a new section with the help of blueprints:

we create a new blueprint called errors and then create a new package directory so we make a "__init__.py" file within this folder we make
a "handlers.py" file were we put "routes" for errors
