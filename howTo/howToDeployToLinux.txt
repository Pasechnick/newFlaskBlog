we have created a linode linux server 

so we have to know the ssh root address that is on, in my case Linode.com 

then we copy this address and insert to our terminal then we need to enter the password for the server and then we are in

after we in the first time we need to upgrade the 

> apt update && apt upgrade // it will update and upgrade the software on the system (ubuntu in my case)
it also might take several minutes depending on performance of the server and system itself

then we need to set the host name

> hostnamectl set-hostname flask-server
> hostname 

< flask-server  // so the name is "flask-server" right now

> nano /etc/hosts   // we go to that file and add the address to hostsfile 

139.162.155.15  flask-server

right now we are logged in as a root user and we can execute every command. that does sound good, but it is best
practice to add a new user that has limited privileges that we can use as our main account
we still can run admin commands using sudo
