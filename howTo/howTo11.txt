We need to restructure our application and learn how to use flask blueprint

We will move the configs on their own file and creation of the app into it's own function. 
The purpose of this is that we can take our current app that has a lot of functionality in few files and split that up on more modules   

By moving the creation of the app in a separate function will allow us to create different instances of our app, 
in cases if we want to have one app for testing and one for deploying(production) - this called application factory

We have to brake our app in different blueprints, this way we archive separate different functionality of the app into their own sections

So, in version 10 of that app we in routes.py file we have many different routes in one file 
and many of them are not related to each other, so as our app grows it will be a mess, the same story is with forms

so we make a package and name it after functionality 

we crete "users", "posts" and "main" directories 
and to make it seen by python as a package we have to make "__init__.py" file inside of the directory and it does not need ro contain something 

so we have to create a "routes.py" file inside of each package and put there routes that have to do something with it's functionality

the also "forms.py" in each package 

we also need to create a "utils.py" file in users directory for some functionality like send picture, send reset password and ect, those are specific to users package

right after we reorganize all the routes and forms where they belong we also need to organize imports,
so some programs like sublime have option where it will show what import is not being used in that file or what import we need to insert

And i have to say the blueprint imports moving is a big pain in the ass, 
so to move all imports and be sure nothing is forgotten or failed to import is difficult, in some cases we also need to change the import location, 
so just double check everything,
but it is nice to have blueprints as the app grows. 

after everything was "imported" we delete our old "routes.py" and "forms.py" files cuz we have moved everything from them in different sections 


then we change links in url_for(), cuz in our new packages we have changed some locations 
and we run the app and click everywhere, delete posts, update and ect. so we know all routes are working 


also we move all configurations to config.py file, and connected this with then we redone the run.py file 

what we also can do is move templates to it's blueprints, so that every blueprint has it's own static and template folders as subfolders in blueprints directory, but cuz the app is not so big it os fine 

do not forget that every package has it's own "__init__.py" file, even this is empty it just mean that the folder is a package
