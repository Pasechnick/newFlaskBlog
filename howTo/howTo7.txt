we have added a default pic for a user account in static directory later we connect it with "url" class in the route account section 

the picture we upload in to update the profile will be always resized in 125 x 125 pixels 

also we can install a package to resize big picture that we might upload, so it prevent slow loading, and saves space on our file system 
> pip3 install Pillow
