now we can add posts by users, full CRUD app, we delete this dummy data 

we should het used to the process of creating a new routes, so that means: 


    @app.route("/theRoute", methods =['GET', 'POST']) 
    @login_required 
    def routes_function():
        variable = instanceOfSomethingWeNeed()
        if form.validate_on_submit():
            ... maybe some instances from forms.py
            ...
            ...
        return render_template('templateForRoute.html', title = 'Title for the Route', additionalArguments = argument, additionalArguments = argument ...)

    then we build a template were we access data that we arrange in the route...

- new route 
- should have a template
- and instances inside route from __init__.py what we need to work with later in the template 
- all important imports within the project or additional extensions



we delete the old dummy data with author and posts

we add new create, update, delete routes
