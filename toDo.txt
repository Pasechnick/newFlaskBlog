1. make a git initialization so i have version control 
    1.2 make sure there are many different versions (branches)

2. push to github so i can later try out how can i clone my project and what kind of problems might occur 

3. make sure there is a requirement.txt file so i can install my dependencies later on a different machine

4. use brew "tree" command helper to see the structure of the project:

├── flaskblog.py
├── forms.py
├── site.db
├── static
│   └── main.css
└── templates
    ├── about.html
    ├── home.html
    ├── layout.html
    ├── login.html
    └── register.html

5. remember that i have setup the database locally, so i might need to create it again on a new machine

6. always add a note file with howTo instructions about the version 


Notiz:

"python3 flaskblog.py" is better instead of "flask run"
